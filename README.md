# iGiantMusic.Importer

This little tool imports music from the Steam version of "Industry Giant II" to the Sweet Transit mod "iGiantMusic".

I open sourced it to show that it only contains harmless code and not violating anything.

Alternativley you could also copy the music from Industry Giant II yourself. It's located under the "soundtrack" folder within your Industry Giant II install directory.

This tool just makes this process easier for you :)

Enjoy!
